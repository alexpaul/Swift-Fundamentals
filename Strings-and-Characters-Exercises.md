# Strings and Characters Exercises 

## Question 1

Write code that prints out all the numbers from 1 to 10 as a single string.
(Hint: the `String()` function can convert an Int to a String)

***
## Question 2

Write code that prints out all the even numbers from 5 to 51 as a single string.

***
## Question 3

***
## Question 4

Print each character in the string `"Hello world!"`

***
## Question 5

Print out the last character in the string below.  You cannot use the Character literal "!" (i.e you must access `myStringSeven`'s characters).

`let myStringSeven = "Hello world!"`

***
## Question 6

Write code that switches on a string, given the following conditions:
- If the string's length is even, print out every character.
- If the string's length is odd, print out every other character.

***
## Question 7

Initialize a String with a character. Show that it is a Character, and not another String, that you're using to initialize it.

***
## Question 8

Build five pairs of **canonically equivalent** strings, the first of each being a pre-composed character and the second being one that uses combinable unicode scalars. Show that they are equivalent.

## Question 12

Print the below flower box using the following information.

- The unicode number for ⚘ is U-2698
- The top and bottom of the box are represented by dashes and the rows are |
- Use the terminator argument in your print statements to print on the same line.
- Hint: It may be useful to try printing out a box of just one character to start then work your way from there.

```swift
Flower Box:
- - - - - - - - - - -
| ⚘ | ⚘ | ⚘ | ⚘ | ⚘ |
| ⚘ | ⚘ | ⚘ | ⚘ | ⚘ |
| ⚘ | ⚘ | ⚘ | ⚘ | ⚘ |

## Question 13

Write a program that sets up a chess board using Unicode.

```swift
Chess Board:
♖ ♘ ♗ ♕ ♔ ♗ ♘ ♖
♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙




♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟
♜ ♞ ♝ ♛ ♚ ♝ ♞ ♜
```

***
## Question 14

You are given a string stored in the variable `aString`. Create new string named `replacedString` that contains the characters of the original string with all the occurrences of the character `"e"` replaced by `"*"`.

```swift
var aString = "Replace the letter e with *"
// Your code here
 ```

Example:

Input:
`var aString = "Replace the letter e with *"`

Expected values:
`replacedString = "R*plac* th* l*tt*r * with *"`

***
## Question 15

You are given a string stored in variable `aString`. Create a new string called `reverse` that contains the original string in reverse order. Print the reversed string.

```swift
var aString = "this string has 29 characters"
var reverse = ""

// Your code here
```

Example:
Input:
`var aString = "Hello"`

Output:
`"olleH"`


## Question 16. Mad-Libs! Add a value to the declared variables below in playgrounds. Insert the variables (already in correct order) inside the stringmadLib and print. 

```swift


var geographicLocation: String
var adjective1: String
var pluralNoun1: String
var adjective2: String
var pluralNoun2: String
var number1: Int
var number2: Int
var articleOfClothing: String

var madLib = "Here is tomorrow's weather report for \()
and vicinity. Early tomorrow, a \()-front will
collide with a mass of hot \() moving from the
north. This means we can expect \() winds and
occasional \() by late afternoon. Wind velocity will
be \() miles an hour, and the high temperature should
be around \() degrees. So, if you're going out, you had
better plan on wearing your \()".
```

## Question 17

You are given a string stored in variable `aString`. Print `true` if `aString` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise. A **palindrome** is a string which reads the same backward or forward.

```swift
let aString = "anutforajaroftuna"

// Your code here
```

Example 1:
Input:
`var aString = "anutforajaroftuna"`

Output:
`true`

Example 2:
Input:
`var aString = "Hello"`

Output:
`false`

***
## Question 18

You are given a string stored in variable `problem`. Write code so that you print each word of the string on a new line.

```swift
var problem = "split this string into words and print them on separate lines"

// Your code
```

Example:
Input:
`var problem ="split this string into words and print them on separate lines"`

Output:
```swift
split
this
string
into
words
and
print
them
on
separate
lines
```

***
## Question 19

You are given a string stored in variable `problem`. Write code that prints the longest word in the string.

```swift
var problem = "find the longest word in the problem description"

// Your code here
```

Example:
Input:
`var problem = "find the longest word in the problem description"`

Output:
`description`

Hint: Keep track of the longest word you encounter and also keep track of its length.

***
## Question 20

Given a string in English, create a tuple containing the number of vowels and consonants.

```swift
let vowels = "aeiou"
let consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"
let input = "Count how many vowels I have!"
```

***
## Question 21

Given a string of words separated by a `" "`. Write code that prints out the length of the last word.

If there is no last word print out `"No last word"`.

Example:
Input: `"How are you doing this Monday?"`

Output: `7`

***

## Question 22

Given a string `testString` create a new variable called `condensedString` that has any consecutive spaces in `testString` replaced with a single space.

```swift
let testString = "  How   about      thesespaces  ?  "
//condensedString = " How about thesespaces ? "
```

***
## Question 23

Given a string with multiple words. Reverse the string word by word.

Example:

Sample Input: `"Swift is the best language"`

Sample Output: `"language best the is Swift"`

***
## Question 24

Given a string with multiple words. Write code that prints how many of them are palindromes.

Example:

Sample Input: `"danaerys dad cat civic bottle"`

Sample Output: `2`

***
## Question 25

You are given a string representing an **attendance record** for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:

`'A' : Absent.`

`'L' : Late.`

`'P' : Present.`

If a student has more than one 'A' or more than 2 continuous 'L's that student should not be rewarded. Print true if student is to be rewarded and False if they shouldn't.

Example:

Sample Input: `"PPALLP"`

Sample Output: `true`

***
## Question 26

Given a tuple with two strings. The first string is a **ransom note**, the second string being the characters from a magazine. Determine whether or not you can construct the ransom note using the characters from the magazine.

Each letter from the magazine can only be used once. You can assume all letters are lowercased.

Examples:

Sample Input1: `("a", "b")`

Sample Output1: `False`

Sample Input2: `("aa", "aab")`

Sample Output2: `True`
