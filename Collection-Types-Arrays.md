# Collection Types - Arrays Exercises

## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
var colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", "lavender"]

print("\(colors[0]), \(colors[2]) and \(colors[colors.count - 1]) are some of my favorite colors")

// orange, yellow and lavender are some of my favorite colors
```
  
</details>

## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

    battingLineup[index] = "Tejada"
  }
  if player == "Thomas" {
    battingLineup[index] = "Guerrero"
  }
}

if let index = battingLineup.firstIndex(of: "Reyes") {
  battingLineup.remove(at: index)
  battingLineup.insert("Reyes", at: 7)

## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
let numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]
let target = 32

var targetNumberFound = false
for num in numbers {
  if num == target {
    targetNumberFound = true
  }
}

print(targetNumberFound) // true
```
  
</details> 

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
```

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
let numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]
let target = 3

var targetNumberFound = false
for num in numbers {
  if num == target {
    targetNumberFound = true
  }
}

print(targetNumberFound) // true
```
  
</details>

## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

print(arrayOfNumbers)

var largestValue = arrayOfNumbers[0]
for num in arrayOfNumbers {
  if num > largestValue {
    largestValue = num
  }
}

print("largest value is \(largestValue)")
// largest value is 199
```

</details> 

***


## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```


<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary> 
  
```swift 
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

print(arrayOfNumbers)

var smallestValue = arrayOfNumbers[0]
for num in arrayOfNumbers {
  if num < smallestValue {
    smallestValue = num
  }
}

print("smallest value is \(smallestValue)")
// smallest value is 0
```
  
</details>

for num in listOne {
  if listTwo.contains(num) {
    sharedElements.append(num)
