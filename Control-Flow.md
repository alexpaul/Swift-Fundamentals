# Control Flow Exercises

> In order to better prepare you for coding challenges where Xcode autocomplete may not be available and also to get you use to recoginzing compiler error without Xcode, please use [repl.it](https://www.repl.it) for the following exercises.

## Question 1

What will be printed when the code below is run?  Select all that apply.

```swift
let conditionOne = !(4 < 5) || !(3 > 8)
let conditionTwo = !(!true)

if conditionOne {
 print("A")
} else if conditionTwo {
 print("B")
}
if conditionTwo {
 print("C")
}
print("D")
```

- A
- B
- C
- D

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let conditionOne = !(4 < 5) || !(3 > 8) // F || T
let conditionTwo = !(!true) // T

if conditionOne { // T
 print("A") // A
} else if conditionTwo {
 print("B")
}
if conditionTwo { // T
 print("C") // C
}
print("D") // D

// A
// C
// D
```
 
</details> 

***
## Question 2

What will the code block below print?  Select all that apply:

```swift
let appInfo = (name: "myCoolApp", version: 0.4)
switch appInfo {
 case (_, 0.0..<1.0):
 print("\(appInfo.0) hasn't released yet")
 case ("myCoolApp", _):
 print("Thanks for looking at myCoolApp!")
 default:
 print("I'm not quite sure what you are looking at")
}
```

- appInfo.0 hasn't released yet
- myCoolApp hasn't released yet
- Thanks for looking at myCoolApp!
- I'm not quite sure what you are looking at
- It will give a compile-time error

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let appInfo = (name: "myCoolApp", version: 0.4) // tuple (name, version)
switch appInfo {
 case (_, 0.0..<1.0): // ignores name argument, only checks for version
 print("\(appInfo.0) hasn't released yet") // "myCoolApp hasn't released yet"
 case ("myCoolApp", _):
 print("Thanks for looking at myCoolApp!")
 default:
 print("I'm not quite sure what you are looking at")
}

// "myCoolApp hasn't released yet"
```
 
</details>

 print("Melts in your mouth, not in your hand")
case "skittles":
 print("Taste the rainbow")
case "snickers":
 print("Hungry? Grab a Snickers")
}
```

- No parentheses around the conditions
- No opening and closing brackets in each of the cases
- No default case in the switch statement
- No print statement right outside the switch statement

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let candyType : String = "skittles"

switch candyType {
case "mAndM":
 print("Melts in your mouth, not in your hand")
case "skittles":
 print("Taste the rainbow")
case "snickers":
 print("Hungry? Grab a Snickers")

Input:
var numberOfSides = 4

Output:
Quadilateral

Example 2:

Input:
var numberOfSides = 2

Output:
Error

```

## Question 11

What is wrong with the block of code below?  Correct it so it behaves as expected.

```swift
let firstName = "Peter"

if firstName == "Peter" {
 let lastName = "Gabriel"
} else if firstName == "Phil" {
 let lastName = "Collins"
}
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
```

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let firstName = "Peter"

// lastName was out of scope, we need to define it outside of if and else..if body
var lastName = ""

if firstName == "Peter" {
 lastName = "Gabriel"
} else if firstName == "Phil" {
 lastName = "Collins"
}
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName 

print(fullName) // Peter Gabriel
```

## Question 12

Write an if statement that prints out what decade of life someone is in (e.g "You are in your twenties). Then, write it as a switch statement.

```swift
let nameAndBirthYear: (String, Int)
```

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let nameAndBirthYear: (String, Int) = ("Kim", 1999)

let currentYear = 2020
let yearsOld = currentYear - nameAndBirthYear.1

if yearsOld >= 13 && yearsOld <= 19 {
  print("You are in your teens.")
}
if yearsOld >= 20 && yearsOld <= 29 {
  print("You are in your twenties.")
}
if yearsOld >= 30 && yearsOld <= 39 {
  print("You are in your thirties.")
}
if yearsOld >= 40 && yearsOld <= 49 {
  print("You are in your fourties.")
}
if yearsOld >= 50 && yearsOld <= 59 {
  print("You are in your fiftees.")
}
if yearsOld >= 60 && yearsOld <= 69 {
  print("You are in your sixtees.")
}

// You are in your twenties. 
```

```swift
let nameAndBirthYear: (String, Int) = ("Kim", 1999)

let currentYear = 2020
let yearsOld = currentYear - nameAndBirthYear.1

switch yearsOld {
  case 13...19: 
    print("You are in your teens.")
  case 20...29: 
    print("You are in your twenties.")
  case 30...39: 
    print("You are in your thirties.")
  case 40...49: 
    print("You are in your fourties.")
  case 50...59: 
    print("You are in your fiftees.") 
  case 60...69: 
    print("You are in your sixtees.")
  default: 
    print("Not a valid range")
}

// You are in your twenties. 
```

## Question 13

Consider the below switch statement. What should your system currently print?

```swift
let number = 42

switch number {
case 365:
 print("Days in year")
case 1024:
 print("Bytes in a Kilobyte")
case 0:
 print("Where arrays start")
case 42:
 print("The answer to life, the universe and everything")
default:
 print("Some uninteresting number")
}
```
What happens when you change number to:

-a. 365?

-b. 1024?

-c. 65?

What happens when you remove the default clause?

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let number = 42

switch number {
case 365:
 print("Days in year")
case 1024:
 print("Bytes in a Kilobyte")
case 0:
 print("Where arrays start")
case 42:
 print("The answer to life, the universe and everything")
default:
 print("Some uninteresting number")
}
// "The answer to life, the universe and everything"

/*
What happens when you change number to:

-a. 365? - prints "Days in year"

-b. 1024? - prints "Bytes in a Kilobyte"

-c. 65? - Some uninteresting number

What happens when you remove the default clause?
- compiler error, the switch must be exhaustive, we need a default statement as numbers are infinite
*/
```

## Question 14

Consider the variable below called population and the if-condition.

a. Add an else-if-condition that states if population is less than 10000 but greater than 5000, then message changes to say it's "a medium size town".

b. Add an else-condition where message changes to say it's a mid-size town.

c. Convert your final if-else statement to a switch statement.

```swift
var population: Int = 10000
var message = String()

if population > 10000 {
 message = "\(population) is a large town"
}
```

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
var population = 10000
var message = ""

if population > 10000 {
 message = "\(population) is a large town."
} else if population < 10000 && population > 5000 {
  // a. 
  message = "\(population) is a medium size town."
} else {
  // b.
  message = "\(population) is a mid-size town."
}

print(message)
// 10000 is a mid-size town.
```

```swift 
 var population = 10000
var message = ""

// c. 
switch population {
  case 10_001...: 
    message = "\(population) is a large town."
  case ..<10_000 where population > 5_000: 
    message = "\(population) is a medium size town."
  default: 
    message = "\(population) is a mid-size town."
}

print(message)
// 10000 is a mid-size town.
```

## Question 15

Complete the code below so that it prints out and tells the user if the sum of the two numbers in the tuple is at least 15.

a. Using a conditional

b. Using a switch statement

```swift
let myTuple: (Int, Int) = (5, 10)
```

<details> 
 <summary>Solution</summary> 

```swift 
let myTuple: (Int, Int) = (5, 10)

// a. 

let sum = myTuple.0 + myTuple.1 
if sum >= 15 {
  print("The sum \(sum), is at least 15.")
}

// The sum 15, is at least 15.

// b. 

switch sum {
  case 15...: 
    print("The sum \(sum), is at least 15.")
  default: 
    print("\(sum) is less than 15.")
}

// The sum 15, is at least 15.
